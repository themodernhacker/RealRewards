  - **Image Placement**:
    - USA: Insert `Q1_figC_USA.jpg` here, after USA results.
    - UK: Insert `Q1_figC_UK.jpg` here, after UK results.
    - Australia: Insert `Q1_figC_AU.jpg` here, after AU results.

### Task D: Heatmap Analysis of the Most Frequent Institution
- **Objective**: Generate heatmaps showing access patterns (day vs. hour) for the most frequent institution in each country.
- **Methodology**: Extracted timestamp data for the top host per country and plotted access frequency.
- **Results**:
  - Heatmaps created for the top institution in each country.
  - **Image Placement**:
    - USA: Insert `Q1_figD_USA.jpg` here, after USA heatmap description.
    - UK: Insert `Q1_figD_UK.jpg` here, after UK heatmap description.
    - Australia: Insert `Q1_figD_AU.jpg` here, after AU heatmap description.

### Task E: Observations and Insights
- **Observations**:
  - The USA led with 218,449 requests, reflecting its larger academic network.
  - The University of Sheffieldâ€™s 2nd ranking (623 requests) highlights its prominence in the UK.
  - Heatmaps showed peak access times, varying by country (e.g., daytime spikes).
- **Insights**: These patterns could guide NASA in optimizing server resources and scheduling maintenance.

## Question 2: Predictive Modeling on Diabetes Data

### Overview
This question involved preprocessing the Diabetes dataset and building regression and classification models to predict hospital stay duration and readmission.

### Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: Loaded locally due to KaggleHub access issues.
- **Transformations**:
  - One-hot encoded 24 medication features.
  - Converted `readmitted` to binary (1 for >30/<30, 0 for NO).
  - Selected `time_in_hospital` as the numeric target.
  - Split data 80/20, stratified on `readmitted`, with seed 67594.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- **Poisson Regression**:
  - **Target**: `time_in_hospital`
  - **Best Parameter**: `regParam=1.0`
  - **Test RMSE**: 2.950454
  - **Visualization**: Validation curve showing RMSE vs. `regParam`.
    - **Image Placement**: Insert `Q2_fig_poisson_validation.jpg` here, after results.
- **Logistic Regression (L1)**:
  - **Target**: `readmitted`
  - **Best Parameters**: `regParam=0.001`, `elasticNetParam=1.0`
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.551642
  - **Visualization**: Validation curve showing accuracy vs. parameters.
    - **Image Placement**: Insert `Q2_fig_logistic_l1_validation.jpg` here, after results.
- **Logistic Regression (L2)**:
  - **Target**: `readmitted`
  - **Best Parameter**: `regParam=0.01`
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.550055
  - **Visualization**: Validation curve showing accuracy vs. `regParam`.
    - **Image Placement**: Insert `Q2_fig_logistic_l2_validation.jpg` here, after results.

- **Methodology**: 4-fold cross-validation with three ALS settings.
- **Settings**:
  - Setting 1: `rank=10`, `regParam=0.1` (default)
  - Setting 2: `rank=20`, `regParam=0.1`
  - Setting 3: `rank=10`, `regParam=0.5`
