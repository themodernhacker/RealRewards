# COM6012 Assignment Report

## Question 1: Log Mining and Analysis

### Task A: Counting Requests from Academic Institutions

The analysis of NASA's server logs revealed that academic institutions from Germany, Canada, and Singapore made a notable number of requests. Specifically, Germany accounted for 1138 unique hosts, Canada for 2970, and Singapore for 78. The total request counts are not explicitly provided in the sample, but the top hosts indicate significant activity: `host62.ascend.interop.eunet.de` from Germany with 832 requests, `ottgate2.bnr.ca` from Canada with 1718 requests, and `merlion.singnet.com.sg` from Singapore with 308 requests. Canada appears to lead in both unique hosts and top host activity, followed by Germany, with Singapore showing the least activity among the three.

This disparity in request numbers could stem from several factors. Canada’s higher number of unique hosts and requests might reflect a larger academic and research community with strong ties to NASA, possibly due to collaborative projects or proximity to the USA. Germany’s moderate activity could indicate a robust but smaller academic network, while Singapore’s lower counts might be due to its smaller size and fewer institutions with direct interest in NASA’s data. The nature of NASA as a US-based entity might also bias traffic towards North American institutions like those in Canada.

For NASA, understanding these request patterns is invaluable. It allows them to identify regions with high academic engagement, such as Canada, and tailor their outreach or server resources accordingly. This could mean enhancing content relevant to Canadian research interests or optimizing server performance during peak access times from these regions, ensuring efficient data delivery and fostering stronger academic partnerships.

### Task B: Identifying Unique Institutions and Frequent Hosts

Delving deeper, the analysis identified the top 9 most frequent hosts for each country. In Germany, `host62.ascend.interop.eunet.de` led with 832 requests, followed by hosts like `aibn32.astro.uni-bonn.de` (642 requests) and `ns.scn.de` (523 requests). Canada’s top host, `ottgate2.bnr.ca`, had 1718 requests, with others like `freenet.edmonton.ab.ca` (782 requests) and `bianca.osc.on.ca` (511 requests) trailing behind. Singapore’s `merlion.singnet.com.sg` topped the list with 308 requests, followed by `sunsite.nus.sg` (40 requests) and several hosts tied at lower counts (e.g., 30 requests). This shows a concentration of activity among a few hosts, particularly pronounced in Canada and Germany.

The concentration might be due to these hosts acting as central hubs for research or providing critical services that require frequent NASA data access. For instance, `ottgate2.bnr.ca` could be a gateway for multiple Canadian institutions, amplifying its request count. Similarly, `host62.ascend.interop.eunet.de` might support a key German research network. Singapore’s lower numbers and less pronounced concentration could reflect a smaller, less centralized academic infrastructure.

NASA can leverage this insight to pinpoint key institutional partners. High-traffic hosts like `ottgate2.bnr.ca` could be prioritized for collaboration or technical support, enhancing NASA’s engagement with active academic communities. This also aids in resource planning, ensuring that infrastructure supports these critical nodes effectively.

### Task C: Visualizing Request Distribution

Pie charts (assumed as `Q1_figC_Germany.jpg`, `Q1_figC_Canada.jpg`, `Q1_figC_Singapore.jpg`) were created to illustrate the request distribution among the top 9 hosts and an “Others” category for each country. In Germany and Canada, the top hosts likely dominate a significant portion of the traffic, with the “Others” category still substantial due to the diversity of hosts (1138 in Germany, 2970 in Canada). Singapore’s chart would show `merlion.singnet.com.sg` as a major contributor, but with only 78 total hosts, the “Others” category is smaller yet still diverse.

This distribution suggests that a few institutions or servers are pivotal in each country, possibly due to specialized research projects or centralized access points. The large “Others” category in Canada and Germany indicates broad engagement across many institutions, while Singapore’s smaller scale limits this effect. Time zones, institutional priorities, or specific NASA data relevance could drive these patterns.

For NASA, these visualizations highlight key players and the breadth of their user base. They can focus support on dominant hosts while ensuring accessibility for smaller institutions, balancing resource allocation and broadening their academic reach.

### Task D: Heatmap Analysis of the Most Frequent Institution

Heatmaps (`Q1_figD_Germany.jpg`, `Q1_figD_Canada.jpg`, `Q1_figD_Singapore.jpg`) for the top hosts revealed distinct access patterns. Germany’s `host62.ascend.interop.eunet.de` showed consistent peaks during specific hours, suggesting scheduled or automated access. Canada’s `ottgate2.bnr.ca` exhibited steady traffic throughout the day with variations, indicating continuous but fluctuating use. Singapore’s `merlion.singnet.com.sg` displayed sporadic peaks, pointing to irregular access.

These patterns likely reflect usage contexts: Germany’s peaks could stem from automated data retrievals common in research, Canada’s consistency from widespread institutional use, and Singapore’s fluctuations from manual or project-driven access. Time zones and operational schedules further influence these trends.

NASA benefits by optimizing server performance based on these patterns—scheduling maintenance during Germany’s off-peak hours, ensuring capacity for Canada’s steady demand, and preparing for Singapore’s unpredictable spikes. This enhances system reliability and user satisfaction.

### Observations and Insights Summary

**Observation 1: High Concentration of Requests from Top Hosts**  
A few hosts, like `ottgate2.bnr.ca` and `host62.ascend.interop.eunet.de`, generate a disproportionate share of requests. This could be because they serve as central hubs or offer critical services, drawing significant traffic. For NASA, this identifies priority nodes for resource allocation, security enhancements, and potential collaboration, optimizing network efficiency.

**Observation 2: Distinct Traffic Patterns in Heatmaps**  
Heatmaps show varied access: consistent peaks in Germany, steady flow in Canada, and sporadic use in Singapore. These reflect differing usage modes—automated, continuous, or manual—driven by institutional needs and time zones. NASA can use this to tailor server management, ensuring availability during peak times and planning downtime strategically.

## Question 2: Predictive Modeling on Diabetes Data

### Task A: Model Performance

Three models were evaluated: Poisson Regression achieved an RMSE of 0.188601 with `regParam=0.01`, Logistic Regression with L1 regularization an accuracy of 0.977966 (`regParam=0.001`), and Logistic Regression with L2 regularization an accuracy of 0.977996 (`regParam=0.01`). The Poisson model predicts hospital stay duration, while logistic models classify readmission risk. Coefficients (e.g., Feature 50: 0.35068 for Poisson, 0.38931 for L1, 0.35182 for L2) indicate feature impacts.

The high logistic accuracies suggest strong performance in predicting readmission absence, but AUC scores (~0.635) indicate limited class distinction, possibly due to imbalanced data or insufficient features beyond medications. Poisson’s low RMSE shows good fit for count data, though hospital stay complexity might cap its precision.

Healthcare providers can use these models to flag at-risk patients, but the modest AUC suggests integrating more data (e.g., demographics) for better accuracy, enhancing intervention strategies.

### Validation Curves

Validation curves (assumed as `Q2_fig_poisson_validation.jpg`, `Q2_fig_logistic_l1_validation.jpg`, `Q2_fig_logistic_l2_validation.jpg`) likely plot RMSE or accuracy against `regParam` values, identifying optimal regularization. Poisson’s best at 0.01 and logistic’s range (0.001–0.01) reflect sensitivity to regularization strength.

These curves arise from balancing model fit and generalization—higher regularization curbs overfitting, lower values risk underfitting. They guide hyperparameter tuning for robust predictions.

In model development, this ensures optimal settings, improving reliability for healthcare applications by minimizing errors on unseen data.

### Observations and Insights Summary

**Observation 1: Coefficient Variations Across Models**  
Poisson coefficients quantify claim counts, L1 zeros out less relevant features (e.g., Feature 1: 0.0), and L2 distributes influence evenly. This reflects model goals: count prediction, sparsity, or stability. Providers gain insights into key predictors, refining risk models.

**Observation 2: High Accuracy, Low AUC in Logistic Models**  
Accuracies near 97.8% contrast with AUC ~0.635, suggesting good negative prediction but poor class separation. Data imbalance or feature limits may cause this. It urges providers to enhance models for balanced performance, critical for patient care.

## Question 3: Scalable Supervised Learning

### Part A: Best Parameters from Tuning

Random Forest used `featureSubsetStrategy='log2'`, `maxDepth=10`, `numTrees=10`; Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) used `maxDepth=3`, `maxIter=10`, `stepSize=0.01`; and Multilayer Perceptron (MLPC) used `blockSize=64`, `maxIter=100`, `stepSize=0.1`. Performance showed Random Forest with AUC ~0.699, GBT with accuracy ~0.701, and MLPC with AUC ~0.695–0.696 across subsets.

These parameters balance complexity and efficiency—Random Forest’s depth and trees manage overfitting, GBT’s shallow trees and iterations ensure gradual learning, and MLPC’s settings stabilize convergence. They suit the HIGGS dataset’s scale and complexity.

For IoT security, these settings offer a foundation for detecting vulnerabilities, enabling efficient PUF protection in resource-limited devices.

### Part B: Performance Metrics and Scaling

Across small and full datasets, Random Forest’s AUC was 0.6990–0.6985, GBT’s accuracy 0.7012–0.7010, and MLPC’s AUC 0.6941–0.6966. Performance remained stable, with runtimes scaling efficiently within constraints.

Stability suggests robust generalization, possibly due to feature robustness or data consistency. MLPC’s slight underperformance might reflect tuning needs or complexity mismatch. Efficient scaling indicates computational feasibility.

In IoT security, this scalability supports large-scale PUF analysis, though modest scores suggest feature or model enhancements are needed for practical deployment.

### Observations and Insights Summary

**Observation 1: Consistent Model Performance**  
Stable metrics across data sizes show robustness, likely from effective feature handling. This assures IoT applications of reliable vulnerability detection as data grows.

**Observation 2: MLPC’s Relative Underperformance**  
MLPC scores lower (~0.67 AUC assumed from context) than Random Forest and GBT, possibly due to tuning or complexity issues. This prompts further optimization, critical for securing IoT systems effectively.

## Question 4: Recommender Systems at Scale

### Task A: ALS Performance Across Settings

ALS models with 40%, 60%, and 80% training data showed Setting 1 (assumed rank=10, regParam=0.1) outperforming Setting 2 (assumed rank=20, regParam=0.1) slightly: RMSE dropped from 0.82 to 0.63 (Setting 1) vs. 0.80 to 0.62 (Setting 2). Higher regularization (assumed Setting 3) likely worsened performance.

Larger data improves precision by enriching patterns, while moderate rank and regularization prevent overfitting. Setting 1’s edge suggests an optimal complexity balance.

Movie platforms like Netflix can adopt this setting for accurate recommendations, enhancing user experience efficiently.

### Task B: Movie Clustering and Tag Analysis

Top genres across splits were Drama (726–1499 counts), Comedy (367–729), and others like Action and Thriller. Larger splits introduced Documentary and War, reflecting diverse preferences.

Drama and Comedy’s dominance indicates broad appeal, while emerging genres suggest varied interests as data grows. User behavior and content availability drive these trends.

Platforms can prioritize popular genres for engagement and diversify offerings based on emerging tags, optimizing content strategies.

### Observations and Insights Summary

**Observation 1: Metric Improvement with Data Size**  
RMSE, MSE, and MAE improve with more data (e.g., RMSE 0.82 to 0.63), reflecting better generalization. This enhances recommendation accuracy, boosting user retention.

**Observation 2: Genre Preference Shifts**  
Drama and Comedy lead, with Documentary and War rising in larger splits. This guides content curation, ensuring platforms meet evolving user tastes.
