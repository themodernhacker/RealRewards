### Observations
1. **Request Volume Disparity**: The USA’s 218,449 requests dwarf the UK’s 25,009 and Australia’s 7,004, reflecting a larger academic ecosystem and proximity to NASA. This aligns with log mining theories suggesting geographic and institutional factors drive access patterns ([Web Log Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/781670)). NASA could use this to optimize server resources in high-demand regions.
2. **Centralized Access in UK**: The UK’s poppy.hensa.ac.uk (4,117 requests) indicates a centralized access point, possibly a national server. This concentration suggests efficient infrastructure but potential bottlenecks, informing NASA’s collaboration strategies.
3. **Sheffield’s Prominence**: Sheffield’s 2nd ranking (623 requests) highlights its active engagement, possibly due to strong aerospace research programs. NASA could target such institutions for outreach, enhancing data utilization.
4. **Temporal Patterns**: Heatmaps likely reveal peak access times (e.g., weekdays, daytime hours), reflecting academic schedules. This supports temporal analysis in log mining, aiding maintenance scheduling to minimize disruption.

## Question 2: Predictive Modeling on Diabetes Data

### Methodology
The [Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) was analyzed to predict hospital stay duration and readmission. The methodology included:
- **Pre-processing**: Selected 24 medication features, binarized ‘readmitted’ (1 for readmitted, 0 for not), and chose ‘time_in_hospital’ as the numeric target. Applied StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, and StandardScaler.
- **Data Splitting**: Split 80% training, 20% test with stratified sampling on ‘readmitted’ (seed: 67594) using [PySpark SampleBy](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.sampleBy.html).
- **Modeling**: Trained Poisson Regression for ‘time_in_hospital’ and Logistic Regression (L1, L2) for ‘readmitted’ using [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator.html), tuning regParam and elasticNetParam.
- **Evaluation**: Reported RMSE (Poisson) and accuracy (Logistic) on the test set, with validation curves.
- **Theoretical Context**: Poisson regression models count data (e.g., hospital days), while logistic regression handles binary outcomes, both regularized to prevent overfitting ([Diabetes Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/781670)).

### Results
| Model         | Metric   | Value   | Best regParam | Best elasticNetParam |
|---------------|----------|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Poisson       | RMSE     | 2.950454| 1.0           | -                    |
| Logistic L1   | Accuracy | 0.551642| 0.001         | 1.0                  |
| Logistic L2   | Accuracy | 0.550055| 0.01          | 0.0                  |

**Figure 8**: Poisson validation curve (insert Q2_fig_poisson_validation.jpg).  
**Figure 9**: Logistic L1 validation curve (insert Q2_fig_logistic_l1_validation.jpg).  
**Figure 10**: Logistic L2 validation curve (insert Q2_fig_logistic_l2_validation.jpg).

### Observations
1. **Poisson Prediction Accuracy**: The RMSE of 2.95 for ‘time_in_hospital’ (range: 1–14 days) indicates moderate error, as predictions deviate by ~3 days. Poisson regression assumes a Poisson distribution for count data, but non-Poisson characteristics (e.g., overdispersion) may limit accuracy. Hospitals could use this for resource planning, though additional features (e.g., diagnoses) might improve predictions.
2. **Logistic Model Limitations**: Both L1 and L2 models achieved ~55% accuracy, barely above random guessing (50%). Logistic regression assumes linear separability, which may not hold for complex readmission factors (e.g., socioeconomic variables). This suggests a need for non-linear models like random forests to capture intricate patterns.
3. **Regularization Impact**: L1’s low regParam (0.001) and elasticNetParam (1.0) indicate sparse feature selection, while L2’s regParam (0.01) balances bias-variance. The similar accuracies suggest medication features alone are insufficient, aligning with healthcare analytics literature emphasizing multifaceted predictors ([Diabetes Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/781670)).

## Question 3: Scalable Supervised Learning for IoT Vulnerabilities

### Methodology
The [XOR Arbiter PUFs dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00463/XOR_Arbiter_PUFs.zip) was used to classify IoT vulnerabilities. The methodology involved:
- **Initial Training**: Trained Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on a 1% subset, tuning three parameters per model via [CrossValidator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator.html).
- **Scaling**: Applied models to fractions (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0) with 10 cores, 10GB memory, and 30-minute runtime limits.
- **Evaluation**: Logged accuracy, AUC, and runtime, plotting trends to assess scalability.
- **Theoretical Context**: Scalable learning leverages distributed systems to handle big data, critical for IoT security where PUFs generate unique device signatures. Poor performance may indicate non-linear or noisy data ([Web Log Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/781670)).

### Results
#### Small Subset (Fraction 0.05)
| Model | Accuracy | AUC       | Runtime (s) |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| RF    | 0.500054 | 0.500444  | 38.67       |
| GBT   | 0.500517 | 0.500536  | 35.55       |
| MLP   | 0.500763 | 0.500056  | 26.19       |

#### Full Dataset (Fraction 1.0)
| Model | Accuracy | AUC       | Runtime (s) |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| RF    | 0.499671 | 0.499559  | 99.07       |
| GBT   | 0.501254 | 0.501960  | 92.66       |
| MLP   | 0.500639 | 0.499778  | 165.60      |

**Figure 11**: Performance trends (insert Q3_fig_performance.jpg).  
**Figure 12**: Runtime trends (insert Q3_fig_runtime.jpg).

**Maximum Dataset Size**: All models processed fraction 1.0 within 30 minutes.

### Observations
1. **Classification Failure**: Accuracy and AUC ~0.5 across all fractions suggest models failed to learn meaningful patterns. PUFs generate cryptographic signatures, but noise or non-linear relationships may render features uninformative. This aligns with challenges in IoT security, where data complexity requires advanced models (e.g., deep learning).
2. **Scalability Success**: All models scaled to the full dataset, with runtimes (e.g., MLP: 165.6s) well under 30 minutes. This demonstrates PySpark’s distributed computing efficiency, crucial for real-time IoT applications.
3. **Runtime Dynamics**: MLP’s runtime increased significantly (26.19s to 165.6s), reflecting neural networks’ computational intensity. RF and GBT’s lower runtimes suggest tree-based models are more scalable for large datasets, supporting their use in big data contexts.

## Question 4: Recommender Systems at Scale

### Methodology
The [MovieLens 25M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) was used to build a recommender system. The methodology included:
- **ALS Training**: Performed 4-fold cross-validation with ALS ([CrossValidatorModel](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidatorModel.html)) on three settings:
  - Setting 1: rank=10, regParam=0.1 (Lab 8, seed: 67594).
  - Setting 2: rank=20, regParam=0.1 (higher rank for more factors).
  - Setting 3: rank=10, regParam=0.5 (higher regularization).
- **Clustering**: Clustered movie factors from Setting 1 using k-means (k=19, seed: 67594), identifying top tags for largest clusters.
- **Evaluation**: Reported RMSE and MAE, visualized performance, and analyzed tags.
- **Theoretical Context**: ALS decomposes rating matrices into user and item factors, while k-means clusters items for content-based insights, enhancing hybrid recommender systems ([MovieLens README](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m-README.html)).

### Results
| Setting | Rank | RegParam | RMSE Mean | RMSE Std | MAE Mean | MAE Std |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1       | 10   | 0.1      | 0.80425   | 0.00018  | 0.62067  | 0.00018 |
| 2       | 20   | 0.1      | 0.80520   | 0.00026  | 0.62452  | 0.00023 |
| 3       | 10   | 0.5      | 0.99918   | 0.00014  | 0.82255  | 0.00012 |

**Figure 13**: RMSE and MAE comparison (insert Q4_fig_metrics.jpg).

**Clustering**: Top tags (e.g., “original,” “mentor”) pending figure insertion.

**Figure 14**: Tag word cloud or table (insert Q4_fig_tags.jpg).

### Observations
1. **ALS Optimization**: Setting 1’s lowest RMSE (0.80425) and MAE (0.62067) indicate optimal balance of rank and regularization. Higher rank (Setting 2) risked overfitting, while higher regParam (Setting 3) caused underfitting, aligning with matrix factorization theories emphasizing parameter tuning ([MovieLens README](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m-README.html)).
2. **Cluster Interpretability**: Clusters likely represent genres/themes (e.g., “action,” “romance”), enabling content-based recommendations. This hybrid approach enhances user experience on platforms like Netflix by combining collaborative filtering with semantic insights.

## Conclusion
This assignment demonstrated PySpark’s power in big data analytics, from log mining to recommender systems. Key findings include USA’s dominance in NASA access, limited predictive power in diabetes modeling, scalable but ineffective IoT classification, and effective movie recommendations. Theoretical insights highlight the importance of feature engineering, model selection, and distributed computing. Future work could explore advanced algorithms and richer features to enhance performance.
