## Supervised Learning for Intrusion Detection

### Overview
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets, where inputs (network traffic features) are mapped to outputs (normal or malicious labels). This approach excels in detecting known attack patterns, making it a cornerstone of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoT networks. The method relies on high-quality labeled data to train classifiers, which are then used to predict the nature of new, unseen traffic in real time.

### Common Algorithms
Several supervised learning algorithms are widely used in IoT intrusion detection:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Model complex relationships in network data, suitable for large datasets.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional data, achieving high accuracy in binary classification.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies based on similarity to neighboring data points, useful for pattern recognition.
- **Decision Trees**: Provide interpretable models, often used as base learners in ensembles.
- **Deep Learning Methods**: Including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which capture temporal and spatial dependencies in traffic data.

### Applications and Performance
Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of supervised learning in IoT IDS:
- A study reported ANNs achieving an average precision of 84% with a false-positive rate below 8% on IoT-specific datasets ([Machine Learning Review](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/18/3601)).
- SVM models have demonstrated up to 99.62% accuracy with a 1.57% false-positive rate on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, showcasing their precision in detecting known attacks.
- KNN, when combined with Decision Trees, achieved 100% accuracy post-normalization on the NSL-KDD dataset, indicating robustness in controlled settings.
- Deep learning approaches, such as CNNs, have been effective for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack detection, with high precision on datasets like KDD Cup 99.

### Advantages

### Real-Time Considerations
For real-time intrusion detection, supervised models must process data quickly. Lightweight algorithms like SVM and Decision Trees are often preferred for their lower computational overhead. However, deep learning models may require edge computing or cloud resources to meet real-time demands, as discussed in studies leveraging Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) for IoT IDS ([MEC-Based IDS](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9143513/)).

## Unsupervised Learning for Intrusion Detection

### Overview
Unsupervised learning operates on unlabeled data, identifying anomalies or outliers that deviate from normal behavior. This makes it particularly valuable for detecting unknown or zero-day attacks in IoT networks, where new threats emerge frequently. By focusing on intrinsic patterns, unsupervised methods complement supervised approaches in comprehensive IDS frameworks.

### Common Algorithms
Key unsupervised learning techniques include:
- **Clustering**: Methods like K-means and DBSCAN group similar data points, flagging outliers as potential threats.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks that learn to reconstruct normal data, detecting anomalies when reconstruction errors are high.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces data dimensionality, enhancing anomaly detection by highlighting significant variations.
- **Density-Based Anomaly Detection**: Identifies anomalies based on data density, effective for complex network traffic.

### Applications and Performance
Unsupervised learning has been successfully applied in IoT IDS:
- K-means clustering, combined with Decision Tree C4.5, was used for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks, though less effective than supervised methods for known attacks ([Machine Learning Review](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/18/3601)).
- Autoencoders outperformed SVM in detecting false data injection attacks in Industrial IoT, offering efficient data recovery and low false-positive rates.
